In the next article, I'll start talking about some Bevy resources I think will help me:

- https://bevyengine.org/ <- Official website + learning resources
- https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap
  - Works with https://www.mapeditor.org/ or https://ldtk.io/ (should I try both?)
- https://github.com/zkat/big-brain <- Just sounds tremendously useful for programming NPC behaviour
- https://rapier.rs/ <- Not sure if I need a physics engine on this level (probably not)
- Plenty more to be found here: https://bevyengine.org/assets/ (look for alternatives to the above too - maybe we can find better)
